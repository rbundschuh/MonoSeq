# MonoSeq
A variant caller for homopolymer runs

MonoSeq is a tool that determines variations in homopolymer run length in Illumina sequencing data.  It is provided with raw reads and a definition of the homopolymer run of interest and reports a variant frequency that is adjusted for the variability of homopolymer run length intrinsic to the Illumina platform.

This tool was developed at The Ohio State University by Ralf Bundschuh, Chris Walker, and Paul Goodfellow.
